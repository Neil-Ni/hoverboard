Through interactive workshops centered around customization, and community-building social events such as meetups, we hope to bring more people in the passionate and wonderful stationery community together, and empower more people to find the perfect creative tools for themselves.\n\nStationery Fest will be August 7-9, 2024. Tickets for entry and reservations for workshops and meetups will be available soon.",
