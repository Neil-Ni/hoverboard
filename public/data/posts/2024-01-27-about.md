Yoseka Stationery was built around the goal of creating a unique experience of trying out your stationery and forming your own opinions on the creative tools we use everyday, all within a community of individuals who share your passion.
At Stationery Fest, we will be bringing together stationery brands and working together with these brands to create experiences that will allow you to learn about each brandâ€™s mission and story, and how these are reflected in their products. Through interactive workshops centered around customization, and community-building social events such as meetups, we hope to bring more people in the passionate and wonderful stationery community together, and empower more people to find the perfect creative tools for themselves.

Stationery Fest will be August 7-9, 2024. Tickets for entry are available here.

Reservations for workshops and meetups will be available soon.
