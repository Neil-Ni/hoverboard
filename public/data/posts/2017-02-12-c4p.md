If you are a stationery brand, artist, educator or an active stationery community member who wants to participate in Stationery Fest, please apply to be a collaborator here!

We are seeking partners who will work with us to make Stationery Fest a unique, interactive and unforgettable experience for attendees! If you are interested in sharing your brand’s mission and story, offering special customization services for products, or have ideas on how to facilitate an interactive workshop for members of the stationery community, please apply and tell us a bit more about your story.

Table reservation prices are below. While selling of products will certainly be part of the event, we want to emphasize the importance of offering a special experience for Stationery Fest attendees. We want visitors to experience your brand, learn what your product is like, how it’s made, how using your product is different and unique from others, and how others in the community may use your product.
