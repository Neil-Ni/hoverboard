We are so excited to share that we have booked and put the deposit down for the beautiful and historic Greenpoint Loft located at 67 West Street, right upstairs from our shop, Yoseka Stationery located at 63 West Street!
Located inside one of a pre-WWII era rope factory in New York, Greenpoint Loft will be the space for Stationery Fest 2024. We hope to be able to bring the impassioned stationery community together for this fun event celebrating our love of stationery!
See you this August 7, 8 and 9 at Stationery Fest!!
